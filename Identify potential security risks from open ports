Identify potential security risks from open ports.
------------------------------------------------
1. Port 22 (SSH)
   - Service: Secure Shell (SSH)
   - Risk: If weak passwords are used or outdated versions are running, attackers can brute-force access.
   - Recommendation: Use key-based authentication and disable root login.

2. Port 23 (Telnet)
   - Service: Telnet
   - Risk: Transmits data in plain text, including credentials. Easily intercepted.
   - Recommendation: Disable Telnet and use SSH instead.

3. Port 80 (HTTP)
   - Service: Web server (HTTP)
   - Risk: Transmits unencrypted data. Vulnerable to MITM attacks.
   - Recommendation: Redirect to HTTPS (port 443).

4. Port 139/445 (NetBIOS/SMB)
   - Service: Windows file sharing (SMB)
   - Risk: Frequently targeted in attacks (e.g., WannaCry ransomware). Risky if exposed to internet.
   - Recommendation: Disable if not needed. Patch regularly.

5. Port 443 (HTTPS)
   - Service: Secure web server
   - Risk: Generally safe if SSL/TLS is properly configured.
   - Recommendation: Use strong certificates, disable outdated protocols (e.g., SSLv2).

6. Port 515 (LPD - Line Printer Daemon)
   - Service: Printer sharing
   - Risk: Outdated and insecure protocol. Can be used to flood print jobs or extract print data.
   - Recommendation: Disable unless necessary.
